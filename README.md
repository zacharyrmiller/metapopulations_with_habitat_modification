#R and Mathematica scripts for "Metapopulations with habitat modification"

This respository contains code accompanying the manuscript "Metapopulations with habitat modification" by Zachary R. Miller and Stefano Allesina. The file *functions.R* contains an implementation of the models described in the text, suitable for numerical integration, along with other useful functions for generating figures and analysis. The file *figures_main.R* generates all figures shown in the Main Text, while *figures_SI.R* generates all figures shown in the Supporting Information. Simulations described in the Supporting Information (without associated figures) are implemented in *simulations_SI.R*.
